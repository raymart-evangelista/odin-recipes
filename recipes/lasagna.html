    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Filling and easy to make, lasagnas are great one-dish meals that check all the boxes, as they can be filled with all sorts of veggies, sauces, and proteins, and can be adjusted to many special dietary needs. Our red and white sauce lasagna is a flavorful combination of a basic white sauce, rather than ricotta cheese, and a tomato-based sauce with beef and pork that's flavored with spices and mushrooms. Covered in cheese and baked until golden, this is a great weeknight meal served with a simple salad and crusty bread.</p>
    <p>We use oven-ready (also called no-boil) lasagna noodles to speed up the cooking time. Simply assemble the lasagna with the uncooked noodles, seal it tight with foil, and bake. As the sauce simmers, the noodles cook all on their own thanks in part to the moisture in the sauces. The key is to keep the lasagna covered in the oven until the noodles are soft. Removing the foil allows the upper layer of the lasagna to achieve an appetizing golden color. The oven-ready noodles are also available in a gluten-free version if someone in your household has special dietary needs.</p>
    <p>Although a few steps are required to complete this dish, the recipe is fairly simple and can be a great first lasagna for novice cooks.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Make the white sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in heavy-bottomed saucepan</li>
        <li>Warm up the milk in a small saucepan, but don't let it boil</li>
        <li>Add flour to the melted butter and stir to form a roux. Cook for about two minutes</li>
        <li>Slowly whisk in the warm milk, stirring well to get rid of any flour lumps. Season with salt</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and reserve, covered.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make the red sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In large skillet, heat up the olive oil and add the ground beef</li>
        <li>Cook until all meat is browned, approx. 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain excess fat, reserving 2 tablespoons in the skillet, and remove the meat mixture from the pan. Cover and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add onion to skillet with reserved fat and saute until translucent, for about 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add mushrooms and garlic to the skillet and cook until the mushrooms are soft</li>
        <li>Return the meat to the pan and stir well</li>
        <li>Add the tomato sauce and dried herbs to the meat, garlic, and onions. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Bring meat sauce to simmer and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the red sauce from the heat and season to taste with salt and pepper</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assemble the Lasagna</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400F. In a baking dish, ladle enough of red meat sauce to cover the bottom of the baking dish</li>
        <li>Arrange a layer of pasta atop the red meat sauce and then another layer of red sauce</li>
        <li>Drizzle white sauce evenly atop the red sauce using only a third of the white sauce</li>
        <li>Repeat the previous step twice by layer layers of pasta, red sauce, and white sauce</li>
        <li>Spread the shredded mozzarella on top of the final white sauce layer</li>
        <li>Cover the dish tightly with foil and bake for 40 minutes</li>
    </ol>
